## Classifiers

### Summary

Implementation of various classifiers for sparse high-dimensional vectors. Uses different representations for the dataset (tf, tf-idf, etc) and assess the performance of each classifier against different representations

### Description

Dataset

The dataset for this assignment is derived from the "Twenty Newsgroups Data Set" that is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Different representations:

- TF
- Binary
- Square-root of TF
- TF-IDF 
- Binary-IDF
- Square root of TF with IDF


Classification approaches

- KNN classifier.
- Centroid-based classifier.
